# File: MusicGenLineairRegessionScikitLearn.py
# Function: First experiment to generate notes based on Lineair Regession estimates
#           based on a musicxml input file. To use Lineair Regession
#           python Scikit-learn module is used.
#           Music data is processed with music21 python module
# Documentation: For multi variant regresion see https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/

# ToDo1:
# Function import_musicxml_file can now only process a input file with one stave.
# Extent this function, so it is able to process a grant staff which contains 2 staves
# See the code in the import_musicxml_file function which determines the TimeSignature em KeySignature of input file
# use myScore.recurse().getElementsByClass() to find the Part objects in score stream of the upper and lower staves.
# Break the loop when more then 2 staves are found 


# ToDo2:
#
# Refactor0
# Apply standard python naming conventions:
# - all capitals for constants
# - no Cammel case or Pascal case bu use underscores for compound concepts


# ToDo3
# Create a copy of this source and use a polynomial regression (Nonlinear regression) in stead of a linear regression.

# The class sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression will be used to perform
# linear and polynomial regression and make predictions accordingly.

# Step 3: Create a model and fit it
mdl = LinearRegression()
# This statement creates the variable model as the instance of LinearRegression.
# You can provide several optional parameters to LinearRegression:
#
# fit_intercept     is a Boolean (True by default) that decides whether to calculate
#                   the intercept ùëè‚ÇÄ (True) or consider it equal to zero (False).
# normalize         is a Boolean (False by default) that decides whether to normalize
#                   the input variables (True) or not (False).
# copy_X            is a Boolean (True by default) that decides whether to copy (True)
#                   or overwrite the input variables (False).
# n_jobs            is an integer or None (default) and represents the number of jobs
#                   used in parallel computation. None usually means one job and -1 to
#                    use all processors.
#
# This example uses the default values of all parameters.
#
# It‚Äôs time to start using the model. First, you need to call .fit() on model:
model = mdl.fit(X, Y)

# Step 4: Get results
r_sq = model.score(X, Y)
# print('coefficient of determination:', r_sq)
# coefficient of determination: ???

# Unneeded code voor music gen
# When you‚Äôre applying .score(), the arguments are also the predictor x and regressor y, and the return value is ùëÖ¬≤.
#
# The attributes of model are .intercept_, which represents the coefficient, ùëè‚ÇÄ and .coef_, which represents ùëè‚ÇÅ:
# print('intercept:', model.intercept_)
# intercept: 5.633333333333329
# print('slope:', model.coef_)
# slope: [0.54]

# The code above illustrates how to get ùëè‚ÇÄ and ùëè‚ÇÅ. 
# You can notice that .intercept_ is a scalar, while .coef_ is an array.

# The value ùëè‚ÇÄ = 5.63 (approximately) illustrates that your model predicts the response 5.63 when ùë• is zero.
# The value ùëè‚ÇÅ = 0.54 means that the predicted response rises by 0.54 when ùë• is increased by one.

# You should notice that you can provide y as a two-dimensional array as well.
# In this case, you‚Äôll get a similar result. This is how it might look:
new_model = LinearRegression().fit(X, Y)

# Step 5: Predict response
# Once there is a satisfactory model, you can use it for predictions with either existing or new data.

# To obtain the predicted response, use .predict():
print("\n\n")
print("Tempory solution voor X_new")
X_new = X # ToDo: create better way to fill X_new
Y_pred = model.predict(X_new)
print('\n\nPredicted response in numeric values Y_pred:', Y_pred, sep='\n')
